title: "Learning based Multi-UAV Collboration"
excerpt: "<Unmanned and intelligent technologies are the future development trend in the business field; particularly, during major epidemics or disasters, how to provide business services safely and securely is crucial. Specifically, providing users with resilient and guaranteed communication services is a challenging business task when the communication facilities are damaged. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with flexible deployment and high maneuverability, can be used to serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to establish emergency networks. However, it is challenging to control multiple UAVs to provide efficient and fair communication quality of service (QoS) to users. In this paper, we propose a learning-based resilience guarantee framework for multi-UAV collaborative QoS management. We formulate this problem as a partial observable Markov decision process and solve it with proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a policy-based deep reinforcement learning method. A centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm is used, where the experience collected by all UAVs is used to train the shared control policy, and each UAV takes actions based on the partial environment information it observes. In addition, the design of the reward function considers the average and variance of the communication QoS of all users. Extensive simulations are conducted for performance evaluation. The simulation results indicate that 1) the trained policies can adapt to different scenarios and provide resilient and guaranteed communication QoS to users, 2) increasing the number of UAVs can compensate for the lack of service capabilities of UAVs, 3) when UAVsimg src='/images/Project03.png'>"
