I am a Postdoc Associate at Robot Dynamics Section as part of the Department of Cognitive Robotics, Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering (3mE), Delft University of Technology.

My research goal is to establish a autonomous learning framework for multi-robot system, especially for applications in special environments (Luanr/Mars rover, rescue robots, etc.). In particular, I am interested in Graph Theory, Reinforcement Learning, cross-modal perception, motion planning and optimal guidacne.
