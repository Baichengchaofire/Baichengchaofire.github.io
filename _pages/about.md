I am a senior researcher working with [Prof. C.Patrick Yue](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eepatrick) at [QWL(Optical Wireless Lab)](http://yuegroup.ust.hk/leadership.html), [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Before, I was a postdoctoral associate working with [Prof. Wei Pan](https://panweihit.github.io/) at the [Department of Cognitive Robotics](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/about/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I received my Ph.D. in Aerospace Science and Technology, specialized in intelligent sensing and motion planning, under the supervision of [Prof. Jifeng Guo](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/guojifeng) in 2019 from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin, China.

My research goal is to establish an autonomous learning framework for a multi-robot system, especially for applications in special environments (Lunar/Mars rover, rescue robots, etc.). In particular, I am interested in graph Theory, reinforcement Learning, cross-modal perception, motion planning and optimal guidance.
