I am a Postdoc Associate at Robot Dynamics Section as part of the [Department of Cognitive Robotics](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/about/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/), [Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering (3mE)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/).

My research goal is to establish a autonomous learning framework for multi-robot system, especially for applications in special environments (Luanr/Mars rover, rescue robots, etc.). In particular, I am interested in Graph Theory, Reinforcement Learning, cross-modal perception, motion planning and optimal guidacne.
